#IT WORKS/ WEBAPP FOR BEST ORM EVER
3 annotations
- PKey- for primary key constraint
- NoNull - for a not null constraint
- Unique - for a unique constraint

Make a model class preferably with public values and public getter/setters,
toString ovverride needed for print statements
put the annotations on top of each class field to make sure it's added correctly
to the sql queries
each class can be turned into a table
Generic servlet service to service each servlet for each class

no jacoco line coverage for now, would implement later if I get to work on it
